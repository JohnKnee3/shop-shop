# 22.1.4

Created a utils/actions.js file and a utils/reducers.js file. This is in place to introduce us to the of using the use reducer hook to update the state of the app. As of right now we simply set and and tested the reducers and did the bare bones for the actions. Next up we are going to learn about global state.

# 22.1.5

We built the globalState. It was a ton to take in and nothing is calling it yet but we are currently able to console.log the actual state. I assume next up is getting it running.

# 22.1.6

Here we refactored categoryMenu, productList and Detail to use the GloabalState. Then we took use state out of Home.js

# 22.2.3

Made all the tests for the cart and then added the reducers to make them pass.
